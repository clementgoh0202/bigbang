# BigBang Script

The "BigBang" script generates an array of numbers and strings based on certain conditions and writes the output to an "output.json" file.

## Instructions

To run the "BigBang" script and generate the output, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If Node.js is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

2. **Download the Script:** Download the "BigBang.js" script to your local machine.

3. **Open Terminal:** Open a terminal or command prompt window.

4. **Navigate to Script Directory:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you downloaded the "BigBang.js" script.

5. **Run the Script:** Execute the following command in the terminal to run the script:


6. **Generated Output:** After executing the script, an "output.json" file will be created in the same directory. The "output.json" file contains an array of numbers and strings generated by the script.

## Generated Output

The "BigBang" script generates an array of numbers and strings based on the following conditions:

- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the string "BIGBANG" is added to the array.
- If a number is divisible by 3 but not by 5, the string "BIG" is added to the array.
- If a number is divisible by 5 but not by 3, the string "BANG" is added to the array.
- For all other numbers, the number itself (in string format) is added to the array.

Here is an example of the generated output:

```json
[
"1",
"2",
"BIG",
"4",
"BANG",
"BIG",
"7",
"8",
"BIG",
"BANG",
"11",
"BIG",
"13",
"14",
"BIGBANG",
...
"98",
"BIG",
"BANG"
]

In this example, the array contains numbers and strings from 1 to 100, with the corresponding replacements based on the conditions mentioned above.
